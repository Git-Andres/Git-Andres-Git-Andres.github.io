<h1>My SWEN Personal Project</h1>
<h2>Andres Caceres</h2>

My name is Andres Caceres and I am from Hackettstown, New Jeresy. My favorite things
to do is to play video games, hike, and to cook some good food.(I Try to to at least).
I lived with my Dad and my sister and my sister is very close to graduting. I went to this school called
Warren Hills Regional High School and there was some memories that I kept that were important. Most of them
were funny like this one time where one of my friends saw a pipe burst out and it was just pouring black liquid.
I like meeting new people and also going out with them as well. Here in RIT, it is very weird to be living without my 
parents and sometimes I miss them, but I have my high school friends and new friends here at RIT so I will be friends


Here is my favorite food
